Result Explanation
==================
A brief usecase for each of the results is provided in our paper (*H. M. A. Mohit Chowdhury, Mattie Fuller and Oluwatosin Oluwadare. Robin:  An Advanced Tool for Comparative Loop Caller Analysis Leveraging Large Language Models (under review)*).

For a comprehensive expalanation and interepretation of eah plots, please review: **Chowdhury, H.M.A.M., Boult, T. & Oluwadare, O.

Overlap
---------------
    * Overlap defines the precentage of common and unique results among the tools.
    * Maximum number of overlaps allowed is 3.

Regression
--------------
    Regression plots shows the stastical correlation among the tools considering the resolutions.

    * It shows the Average Bin Size (of the number of bins) vs. Resolution. 
    * It shows the Average Bin Size (of the number of bins in KB) vs. Resolution. 
    * It shows the regression plots.
    * It shows the category regression plots.

Protein (e.g. CTCF)
------------------------------
    * Protein plots are the biological validation plots. It is available per resolution uploaded by the user.
    * It contains a plot of  
    * The Protein plot is a plot of
    
    * Users can observe other tabs named with the protein as much as user provide them. User can toggle tools, view specific resolution results.

HiGlass
---------------------------------
    * HiGlass has different features. Here, we demonstrate a little features. User referred to go through the full document `here <https://higlass.io/>`_.

LLM
----------------------------------------
    * Users can generate plots with their own interest which is not provided default in Robin. It also has Jupyter Notebook builtin to edit the code. To enable AI assistant, users need to provide api key and select a model name specific to the provided api key. User can see the ai generated results in the right top and a jupyter notebook is available to edit the generated code at the immediate bottom of the results.
